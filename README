I've decided to make this project open source. It can be downloaded here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.androidinspain.otgviewer

You will need:

- Android Studio
- v7 Support library

With OTGViewer you can:

- Browse all the contents from your USB (FAT32). You won't have to worry about anything, each file will be opened with the best app for it.
- Enjoy watching your photos with the embedded photo viewer included in OTGViewer. Thanks to the used algorithms, you won't have to wait for the next photo.
- Slides mode: enjoy the best experience watching photos with your family or friends. You won't have to pass them manually; they will do automatically and the transition speed can be easily regulated with swipe gestures (up or down, respectively).
- Android TV support + remote controllers (Nexus Player, for example). Make the most from your Android TV!

Note: libaums library is being used. Therefore, your device doesn't need root nor modified kernels. Only USB OTG support is required.

I really hope you like OTGViewer. I look forward your comments/suggestions in order to improve it. Thank you!
